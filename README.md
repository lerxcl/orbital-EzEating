EzEating's logo:

The fork looks like the letter ‘E’, since EzEating consists of 2 ‘E’s.

The bowl represents our all-in-one hub concept, where users can look for their favourite food, look at the menu options and all of the available payment and discount options.

# Motivation
An increase in e-payment methods in recent years has led to an increase in demand for applications that complements this trend. 
In addition, Singaporeans love cheap thrills, as seen from the popularity of cashback apps such as Shopback and paid subscription 1-for-1s like Burpple Beyond. However, these apps often only show the deals that are provided by the app itself, and do not compare deals across different applications and platforms. 
Hence, there is a need for an app that helps reduce the hassle users have to go through when trying to find the best deal, by doing that job for them.

# Aim
We aim to create a one-stop hub where users can visit before their transactions in order to get the best deals. 
We also aim to provide a easy platform for Merchants to update their store's information, so that there will be no misinformation for the consumers.

# Scope of Project
Our project will focus on building an integrated platform that provides users with all the different ways they can pay at a particular store, and help them decide which e-payment method to use, possibly based upon which confers them the highest savings. 
A possible extension is to have e-payment apps directly link to our app, so that redirection to these external apps such as GrabPay, etc. will be possible. 

# Technology Stack
